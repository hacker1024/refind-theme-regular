# rEFInd theme Regular

A fork of @bobafetthotmail's refind-theme-regular, configured to my liking.
No additional functionality is added on this fork's master branch; use the upstream version.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository in your rEFInd directory (or add a submodle if your ESP is a Git repository).
2. Add `include refind-theme-regular/theme.conf` at the end of refind.conf.
